# LacunaExpress

This is a supplemental application that is designed to work with The Lacuna Expanse (http://www.lacunaexpanse.com/). The app will have various functionalities, all of which require the user to know and understand the Lacuna Expanse game. 

I will be erasing this folder and uploading from scratch with existing code to prevent errors where the repo cannot be cloned/ compiled.
